# Angular-MVC
A little test application to demonstrate a couple of issues i was having with Angular and MVC

This is based on an awesome Pluralsight course by Miguel Castro (Building End-to-End Multi-Client Service Oriented Applications - Angular Edition)

In it he guides the viewer through the process of creating a web app, using angular and MVC.

Some bits caught me out, including routing and getting the Mini SPA's (Single Page Apps) to play nicely with each other.
So this is a heavily cut down demo app, that demonstrates this concept.
